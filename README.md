Karel-Conundrum
===============

Multiple robots that search for objects

Each member of the team will create a new class the extends the traditional Karel robot to include a find method.  The when called this method should move the robot within the playing field until it finds an object.  For now we will start with a set field (let's say 100 by 100), but our next step could be to make the field an argument given to the find method.

Our leader will create the main class that initializes the playing field and creates and instance of each robot.  For now, we will need to call each robot's find method, wait for it to finish and record the time (for now I will use a stop watch, but we could get the system time before and after and display the results at the end).  Later we can look into running all the robots at once.

I guess this type of chanllenge needs a prize.  Let's try to finish this project on Monday.  Have a great weekend.
